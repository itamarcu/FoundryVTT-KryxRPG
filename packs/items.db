When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five&nbsp;Orbs of Dragonkind&nbsp;(or&nbsp;Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p>\n<p>As the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p>\n<p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.</p>\n<p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p>\n<p>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.</p>\n<p>While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts @Compendium[kryx_rpg.spells.zMAWdyc8UVb37BK4]{Suggestion} on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires.

The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.</li>\n<li>As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.</li>\n<li>As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.</li>\n<li>As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Roll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"DMG pg. 173","quantity":1,"weight":2,"price":16000,"attuned":false,"equipped":false,"rarity":"Very rare","identified":true,"activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":"","isScaling":false},"target":{"value":null,"units":"","type":"","isScaling":false},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":""},"ability":"","actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":null,"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"dc":null,"scaling":"","type":""},"armor":{"type":"clothing","value":0,"dex":0},"strength":null,"stealth":false,"proficient":true,"attributes":{"spelldc":10},"consume":{"type":"","target":"","amount":null}},"sort":2000000,"flags":{},"img":"systems/kryx_rpg/icons/skills/yellow_07.jpg"}
